The program here is meant to verify a riddle that states given any number x, (2 * x + 6) / 2 - x == 3. There are 7 test inputs to be checked, all of which are members of the rational numbers. For each test input, the program will print out to the console line by line the calculations required by substituting x for that test input in the riddle's formula. 6 of the test inputs are hardcoded constants, while one input is reserved for the user to provide an integer or decimal.
